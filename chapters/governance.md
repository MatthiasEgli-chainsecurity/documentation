# Governance

## Current Governance
Staking value only has effective economic incentive if the value can be lost. The current iteration of the Melon Protocol provides a mechanism to penalize staking Price Feed Operators for perceived misconduct or negligence. The mechanism allows the Melonport AG multi-signature wallet to specifically and discretionarily "burn" staked MLN Tokens, effectively appropriating and removing the offending Price Operator's stake, in a provable way, from the MLN Token supply.

## Future Governance
It is the intention provide a more decentralized governance mechanism which can be applied to different domains of the Melon Protocol, including Price Feed Operator Governance. This envisions the creation of a "Technical Council" to adjudicate. For further details on the Technical Council, please refer to the Governance section.
